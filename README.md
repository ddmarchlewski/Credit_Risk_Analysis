# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
In this project, we are asked to predict credit risk. We predict it by using Python to build machine learning models. We evaulate the data using the following models.
- Using SMOTE and RandomOverSampler to oversample the data.
- Using ClusterCentroids to undersample the data. 
- Using SMOTHEEN to combine the oversample and undersample data. 
- Using BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, which reduce bias, and compare the two machine learning models. 

## Results
RandomOverSampler Module
- This module's accuracy test was 65%. 
- High_risk is low with 1%.
- Low_risk is 100%.
- Recall high risk is at 72%.
- Recall low risk is at 63%.
